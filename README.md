### Hello there!

My name is Jesus Guio, I'm a Game/Engine developer from Colombia, I have passion about games especailly RTS. I love to work with low-level stuff such as Game Engines development so I focus all my learning and work in doing this such as Rendering, AI, Netwrking, etc. But also I like to use engines such as Unity, Unreal Engine and Godot, for create small games and learn new things.
