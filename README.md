### Hello there!

My name is Jesus Guio, I'm a Game/Engine developer from Bogot√°, Colombia. Since I was 4 and played Age of Empires II with my father, I have passion about games and know that is I want to do, make games. Currently, I'm working in a game engine named [Raven Engine](https://gitlab.com/Steback/ravenengine) and my goal is to make a diablo-like game with it, so far the engine development is very early, but I hope progress fast in it.
